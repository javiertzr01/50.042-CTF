Alice and Bob are both students, in a relationship, who took the 50.042 Foundations of Cybersecurity module. During the module, Alice gave Bob
a number, and told Bob that this number would be his private key if they ever used RSA. Alice was convinced that as long as the prime numbers
she chose for n were large enough that RSA will be secure. Alice is now on Global Exchange and wishes to send Bob a message that she
absolutely cannot allow anyone else to know about. Thus, she took measures to setup a communication channel to send Bob a message. As a nosy
individual, you really want to know what the message is.

Note: Aliceâ€™s favourite cipher is vigenere cipher and she only likes alphabets

Hint: Think about how to crack RSA when p,q are relatively close to each other, where p * q = n\

P.S: Using libraries like gmpy2 or sage will make your life a lot simplier
